This application uses javascript to generate a random string based on user input for number of characters and type of characters to use. It uses text-entry for the number of characters to be used and validates for a number between 8-128. Then it uses confirms to ask the user for each type of character they want included. These confirms save to variables as true if they are confirmed. Then the application checks the truth value of each one and adds an array consisting of all possible characters of that type. It uses the split function to turn a long string into an array of individual characters, then adds them to an array of all possible characters if true. A for loop iterates for the number of characters selected and uses math.random to pick and save a random character from the possible characters array.
